# On the topic of working asynchronously

A note before we begin. The following work was taken from https://xahteiwi.eu/resources/presentations/no-we-wont-have-a-video-call-for-that/ and the assosciated youtube talk. This version of the document attempts to distill all content down even further but the reader is encouraged to follow up by consuming the primary source as well.

## WHY

The remote-first workplace requires that we change the way we interact and function in our workplaces.

It is unreasonable to presume that with a distributed team, the same behaviors and working styles which work within a colocated office setting are productive, optimal or, necessary.

> Effective distributed collaboration is not pretending to be in an office while staring into a webcam all day.

Working in a distributed world requires changing habits and processes in order to ensure an optimal use of productive hours while allowing individuals time to engage in self-care.

We need to learn to work **asynchronously**.

This has numerous further advantages, including but not limited to:

- allows team members to work in different time zones
- maintain their own daily schedule
- work when they are most productive
- move away from HCOL areas
- reduce or elminate their commute time
- reduce environmental impact as associated with a commute
- businesses can save a siginifcant expense on office space
- ultimately, the reduction in the duration and number of meetings

Consider that a 1 hour meeting with 9 atendees is a 9 hour meeting fromt he perspective of the business. It is incumbent on our teams to optimize the value of time spent in meetings to ensure that all meeting attendees' time is respected and used productively.

While the initial talked was boldly framed around the elimination of meetings. At its core, it is ultimately about communication. Witht he understanding that:

> **Nothing** has as dire an impact on productivity as **poor communications**.

This document attempts to enumerate the modes of communication we have available to us, provide the arguments for how each mode is best used and, warnings about how they may be misued.

## WHAT



Information that you cannot access has no value:
- something that only one person knows is impossible to access without that person
- something that is said in a video requires the video be viewed, this does not necessarily scale
- something that is communicated in a video meeting doesn't exist if it is not written down or remembered
- something that was said on slack (or any text chat) is unretrievable without custom phrases and a general idea of when and which channel it was said in
- something that was written in an email is slightly more retrievable




## HOW


In order to learn to w, **we must learn to communicate asynchronously**.



> A capable distributed team **habitually externalises** information.
