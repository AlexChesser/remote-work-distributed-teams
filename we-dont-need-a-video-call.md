# Notes on remote work strategies

## Preamble 

What follows is a heavily edited transcript of the talk by Florian Haas.

[![Youtube video link](https://img.youtube.com/vi/NVnci3tyDa4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVnci3tyDa4)

The intention is to enable rapid consumption and sharing of his ideas without having to sit throught he the (frankly amazing) 1 hour talk.

This is a phase one work in progress document, and some effort may be made at a later date to further cluster and consolidate the contents of the video into a more logical and consumable sturcture.

## Introduction

> effective distributed collaboration in a Team is not pretending to be in an office while staring into a webcam all day

> You will never be able to capitalize on work as a distributed team unless you kick some office habits

> to expect success from taking the habits of an office and then simply removing the element of locality and then replace every face-to-face meeting with a video call and otherwise carry on as if nothing happened is patently ludicrous

the key to distributed teams being effective is

- not that they're distributed
- not that they're not all in the same place
- it's the way the comunicate

if you do distributed teams right you'll end up with:

- a more productive team than a local one would ever be
- a more resiliant team with robust onboarding material
- a chance of better work-life balance
- less wasted meeting time
- lowered consumption of fossil fuels on your commute

## Themes

- why distributed teams always collaborate asynchronously
- what communication modes lend themselves to that particularly well
- why written communication is so important in distributed teams much more important than spoken communications
- why meetings like video calls are a mode of communication that effective distributed teams hardly ever need to use
- what exceptions exist where video calls are useful

## Caveat

- This content is OPINION, based on anecdote and, one personâ€™s experiences.
- You are free to rebut or offer other positions.

## Defining a distributed team

> a distributed team is a professional group whose members do not rely on proximity in order to routinely collaborate productively

- key points:
  - **professional**: this isn't a hobby it is a job
  - on an everyday basis work in a distributed fashion
  - lack of proximity is not only spatial but also temporal

> working in a distributed team means working asynchronously

- people work on things on their own time  
- work in parallel
- have as few synchronization points as are absolutely necessary
- might work in different time zones
- everyone will have their own daily routine
- everyone will have individual times when they're most productive

> Don't attempt to synchronize if you're managing a distributed team

- trying to synchronize daily schedules sets up the entire team for
failure.

## Cost: Effective Distributed teams don't come for free

- we need to learn how to work in a distributed manner.
- The technology to enable distributed teams is only quite recent.
- We are fighting against millenia of evolution and social conditioning which required synchrony.
- we do have to acquire the collaboration and communication skills

> absolutely nothing has as dire an impact on productivity as poor communications

- This applies to both distributed and non-distributed teams
- if you have bad communications as a surefire way to wreck any project blow any budget
- good communications does not guarantee success but having
- bad communications guarantee failure

> A capable distributed team habitually and routinely externalizes information

- information stored only in one person's head represents a risk to the business
- it is not as useful
- important information should be
  - easy to find
  - easy to share
  - provide context

- this becomes a win for everyone

-------

## Modes of communication

- distributed team will routinely use multiple modes of communication on a daily basis
  - rely mostly on those that make sharing, finding and contextualizing information easy
  - it will avoid those that make it difficult

### Text chat for communication (slack, IRC)

- using text chat as a default mode of communications is becoming the norm
- this is not a symptom a particularly dynamic or efficient team
- the opposite in fact it's a symptom of a particularly bad kind of laziness
  - not malice
  - not with bad intentions

- using chat for everything is an attempt to communicate quickly and easily for yourself
- makes making things harder for everyone (including yourself)
- chat is extremely easy as a fire and forget mode of communication
- makes it very difficult to find information or retrieve information after the fact
  - example: find something specific in a busy slack channel
  - almost impossible unless you specific key phrases that you can search for
  - private chats are inaccessible to any members who are not in them
  - discussions might be split across channels
  - discussions might be split across weeks
  
### Email

- email makes it very easy to share information with a person or group
- quite difficult to loop the same people into an ongoing discussion
after the fact after it has started (long email chains)
- finding information is just as hard as with chat
- marginally better at contextualizing information because of proper
threading

### Wiki / Issue Tracker

- provided that you don't lock them down with like silly permissions
- they make it really very easy to share, find and, contextualize information
- a wiki is shorthand for any facility that allows you to collaboratively edit long
form documents online
  - actual wiki
  - google docs
  - confluence
- issue tracker could be anything like:
  - jira
  - fogbugz
  - bugzilla
- all allow us to link bits and pieces of information together by adding cross references
- makes it very easy to contextualize information
- makes sharing the information easy
- assuming good search and table of contents facility also makes it very easy to find things
- wiki and issue tracker are critical

### Video Calls

- video calls however video calls are worse than all of the others
- sharing information doesn't scale
  - have to watch the entire video
  - seek to the important part
  - large files
  - much slower than reading
- you can't reasonably have more than five or so people in a video call
- sharing the recording of a video call is just completely pointless

## What is the alternative to a video call?

- make your wiki and your issue tracker are your default mode of communications
- use all the others quite sparingly
- not meant to be a euphemism for don't use them
- video calls for just very specific reasons

- back to chat (slack)
- a very specific type of situation in which text chat is absolutely a good thing 
- interactive chat is really good immediate and interactive mutual feedback from two or more participants
- the only thing that chat is good for is communication that is required to be
synchronous
  - in a distributed team asynchronicity is the norm
  - chat should be an exception
  - try to use your issue tracker / wiki

- use chat if you need all of:
  - you want or need immediate feedback
  - you need mutual back and forth with the other person
  - you don't want others to follow the conversation

alternatives to the chat use case:

- if you don't need immediate mutual feedback but want a private exchange of ideas use encrypted email
- if you want to collaborate with an individual before charing widely, use restricted permissions on a wiki page.

### Chat ettiquette and best practices

- If you use a shared private channel, you can add people
- pinging someone in a chat which is mentioning their username usually triggers some form of a visual or auditorynotification
- that's exactly like walking up to a person tapping them on the shoulder and asking them a question
- a chat ping is exactly the same thing
- no matter whether it's your intention or not that person is going to feel compelled to answer relatively promptly
- that means that you're potentially breaking a flow state
- pinging someone in a chat is something that you should do only if you're aware of exactly this risk
- a naked ping is the action of sending someone a message that consists only of
their username od a word like "hi" or "hey"
- when you ping someone always add context
- don't say can i ask you your question, instead just ask the question. Providing the additional context will allow someone to judge whether the thing you're aksing is a 5 minute task or a 4 hour one.

## Back to video calls

- the only reason to use video calls is to be able to pick up on non-textual and non-verbal cues
- that's a very good reason
- it's really the only reason
- have a very significant drawback: they're only half on the record
- hardly anyone goes to the trouble of preparing a full transcript
- at best a sumamry of the notes
- even if we keep recordings of every video call, no one watches them
- practically impossible to discern after the fact what was discussed
- as with scouring a chat archive, with video calls that's even worse
- every video call needs an agenda (any meeting)
  - let people know what to exepct
  - give  people the option to prepare
- don't have video calls without an agenda
- write notes and a summary of every meeting that you attend
- circulate them to everyone who has a need to know
- it's the record of a call that counts
- not the spoken word, it's the written one
- a proper write-up of a call takes more time and effort than the call itself if you think that
- the only way that a video call is ever less work is when everyone's lazy
- without a record of what was decided, the caller is useless

- every meeting needs notes and a summary
- and they need to be circulated
- if you follow the same structure they look pretty much the same:
  - meeting title at the top
  - date time and attendees
  - executive summary 
  - the discussion points in a table
  - action items and takeaways
- once you adhere to this standard you'll quickly notice that frequently you can actually skip the meeting altogether and just use a collaboratively edited document
- once you've removed the meeting you've removed an unnecessary synchronization point

### So ... cancel our zoom subscriptions?!

- one thing video calls are actually good for
- use them for recurring meetings as an opportunity feel the pulse of your team
- connect socially
- we strive to minimize synchronization points so we aim to end:
  - daily stand-ups or check-ins
  - sprint planning meetings
  - sprint retrospectives
- one meeting a week or two in a video call is useful to pick up on non-verbal cues like:
  - body language, posture, facial expression, tone
  - if people are unhappy that'll show
  - if they're relaxed and productive that's going to show too
- the video call is really just for that for the purpose of that emotional connection

## Writing things down

- the content of all meetings should be documented
- briefing notes should have a five paragraph format
  - **situation**: about the position that we're in (WHY)
  - **objective**: what we want to do
  - **plan**: How we are going to do it
  - **logistics**: Budget and resoucres (who)
  - **communications** Who needs to know and how we tell them

## Dealing with the constant stream of asynchonoous comms

- what i'd like to call what i like to call pinching the firehose 
- dealing with a constant incoming stream of information from all sides
- apply your own structure to that stream
- otherwise you're going to feel constantly overwhelmed 
- and run a high risk of burnout

### the 4d approach

- reference: david allen's "getting things done"
- apply to any incoming bit of information
  - **drop**: I don't need this, read, understand, archive the informtaion and, move on
  - **delegate**: things that do require action but not from you. Get it to the right person, make a note to follow up and, move on.
  - **defer**: needs doing and it's you who needs to do it but not now. Add it to your task list and, come back to it later
  - **do**: typically very few that need to be done, by you, immediately

- doesn't mean that you'll never be overwhelmed 
- but will greatly reduce that risk and make things more manageable

### rules for dropping

- dropping things it doesn't mean that you ignore them
- you still have to read and understand
- want to be able to find that information later
- archive in a way that keeps them retrievable

### notes on delegating 

- requires that you have a person you can delegate
- not necessarily someone who reports to you
- might be someone you report to
- find the right person who can get the task done
- often overlooked you want to ask them to acknowledge
  - they have received your message
  - they have have got all the information that they need
  - this removes the need to follow up later
  - "ack" is typically enough :)
- when you delegate to a direct report, this does not remove the responsibility to get it done (scratch the point about follow up above)
- you don't delegate the responsibility just delegate the task

### defer and do

- kindof obvious

## Informal Discussion

- this all souds so professional ... but also so very isolating.
- informal discussion is indispensible
- it is wildly valuable for organizations
- the kind of stuff that simply contributes to people's relaxation and well-being and emotional connectedness and empathy
  - some people don't care about conenction with colleagues
  - recognize and accept that
  - introverts might thrive while being left alone
- there is room for informal conversation in a distributed team
  - agree on a signal which means that "i'm taking a break and i'll be happy to chat with anyone who's inclined  preferably about non-work related things"
  - a keyword like "fika", "coffee break" an emoji

### chat ops

- medium length description of an entirely different mode of working. Not terrible relevant here, but super interesting, check the original video :)

## Conclusions

- distributed teams are better than localized teams
- not because they're distributed but because they're inherently asynchronous
- that is a far superior method of collaboration
- if you're running a you want to avoid anything that makes that distributed team run synchronously

- use less chat
- have fewer meetings
- write things down
